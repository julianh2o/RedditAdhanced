Reddit Adhanced
===============

This script requires GreaseMonkey and/or Tampermonkey. Install those first before trying to use this.


This is active primarily on the https://www.reddit.com/promoted page and will load in information from both the "traffic" and "edit" ad pages.

For each link, a table is inserted that displays your individual campaigns.

You can quickly create a **subreddit** campaign using the "Create Campaign" form. The fields are subreddit, start date, end date, total budget (USD), and max bid for 1000 impressions respectively.

An "archive" link is added to the list of actions for each link. Use this to hide old promotions that you're not interested in. This will save load time as the tables are not generated for archived links.

At the top of the page, you can select a payment method and default values for campaign creation. The subreddit field is not included because it is chosen automatically for promotions based on the most recent campaign for that link. This was designed this way to meet my own needs as I write unique copy for each subreddit.

I hope you find this useful, please feel free to submit pull requests and issues. I can't guarantee that I'll implement a full set of features, but I'll definitely look into any bugfixes.
